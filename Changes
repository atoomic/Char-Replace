Revision history for Char-Replace

{{$NEXT}}

- New: code ref (callback) map entries for dynamic replacement in replace()
  — callback receives the character, return value becomes the replacement
  — return undef to keep original, empty string to delete
  — replace_inplace() croaks on code ref entries (use replace() instead)
- Fix: memory leak when a code ref callback dies during replace()
  (reply SV was not freed on exception; now uses G_EVAL + croak_sv)
- Fix taint propagation: replace() and trim() now correctly propagate the
  taint flag from input to output (previously laundered tainted data)
- New trim_inplace(): zero-allocation in-place whitespace trimming
  (modifies string directly, returns count of bytes removed)
- UTF-8 safety: multi-byte sequences (>= 0x80) are now copied through
  unchanged; replacement map is only applied to ASCII bytes (0x00-0x7F)
- IV/NV map entries: integer values treated as character ordinals (chr)
- Empty string map entries now delete the character from output
- Fix off-by-one: map[255] is now reachable (>= vs > boundary)
- Fix type safety: unsigned char for byte handling, STRLEN for loop vars
- New replace_inplace(): zero-allocation in-place 1:1 byte replacement
  (up to 3.5x faster than replace() for long strings)
- New build_map(): convenience constructor from char => replacement pairs
- Perf: replace() writes directly into SV buffer (avoids temp alloc+copy)
- Perf: precomputed 256-byte lookup table fast path for 1:1 maps in both
  replace() and replace_inplace() — eliminates per-byte SV type dispatch;
  replace() on long strings is now faster than Perl's tr///
- Refactor: extract UTF8_SEQ_LEN macro for shared UTF-8 byte handling
