Revision history for Char-Replace

{{$NEXT}}

- UTF-8 safety: multi-byte sequences (>= 0x80) are now copied through
  unchanged; replacement map is only applied to ASCII bytes (0x00-0x7F)
- IV/NV map entries: integer values treated as character ordinals (chr)
- Empty string map entries now delete the character from output
- Fix off-by-one: map[255] is now reachable (>= vs > boundary)
- Fix type safety: unsigned char for byte handling, STRLEN for loop vars
- New replace_inplace(): zero-allocation in-place 1:1 byte replacement
  (up to 3.5x faster than replace() for long strings)
- New build_map(): convenience constructor from char => replacement pairs
- Perf: replace() writes directly into SV buffer (avoids temp alloc+copy)
- Refactor: extract UTF8_SEQ_LEN macro for shared UTF-8 byte handling
